	<p>But don't get too smug. There's still plenty of horrific ways it could all fall apart. In this article, 
	you'll learn about a few of our favorites.</p>
	
	<h2>Mayan Doomsday</h2>
	<p>Skeptics suggest that the Mayan calendar simply rolls to a new 5, 126-year era after 2012, and doesn't
	actually predict a life-ending apocalypse. But given that the long-dead Mayan were wrong about virtually
	everything elase, why should we trust them on this?</p>
	
	<h2>Robot Takeover</h2>
	<p>Not quite as frightening as a Vampire Takeover or Living-Dead Takeover, a robot rebellion is still 
	a disquieting thought. We are already outnumbered by our technological gargets, and even Bill Gates fears
	the day his Japanese robot slave turns him over by the ankles and asks (in a suitably robbic voice)
	"who's your daddy now?"</p>
	<h2>Unexplained Singularity</h2>
	<p>We don't know how the universe started, so we can't be sure it won't just end, maybe today,
	and maybe with nothing more exciting than a puff of anti-matter and a slight fizzing noise.
	</p>
	  
	<h2>Global Epidemic</h2>
	<p>Some time in the future, a lethal virus could strike. Prediction differ about the source
	of the disease, but candidates include monkeys in the African jungle, bioterrorists, 
	birds and pigs with the flu, warriors from the future, and alien race, hospitals that use too many
	antibiotics, vampires, the CIA, and unwashed brussel spouts. Whatever the source, it's clearly bad news.</p>
